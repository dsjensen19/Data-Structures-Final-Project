# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Data Scientist will need to know about these basic topics:

- [Stacks](Stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](LinkedLists.md)
- [Trees](Trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
